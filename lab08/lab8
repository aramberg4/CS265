1.  i.   Users should see and be able to access only that which is needed.
    ii.  Write small functions that don't overlap and carry out a singular task.
    iii. Don't use tricks or shortcuts and mislead the user about what is actually going on under the hood especially when it modifies input data in an unexpected way. 
    iv.  Consistency will reduce the amount of confusion for users when they can reasonably expect certain behaviors.
2.  Fixed sizes for lines and fields. Doing things behind the users' backs like unquote. Also there a few functions that do several things.
3.  There are more functions that each accomplish one thing that are used in larger functions like csvgetline and main.
4.  There is no encapsulation and multiple files acan't be parsed concurrently.
5.  Yes, concurrent processing is accomplished through having a class and being able to create as many instances that you want.
6.  Yes, as far as I can tell it seems to adhere to all 4 guidelines and supports concurrent processing.
7. See edited csv.c
