9. Vim told me: "E45: 'readonly' option is set (add ! to override)"
*Please note that I already had a file named "index.html" in my public_html directoy from a previous class. I did not want to overwrite it so I named the file for this class "index265.html". I was still able to navigate to it from a web browser.
10. Output:
	- All files were listed
	- Files that began with a were listed
	- The annoy file was listed
	- Nothing was listed because there were no files with a single wildcard character after annoy
11. Vim created two files named "a" and "space".
